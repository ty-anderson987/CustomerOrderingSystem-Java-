## Part 1 – Class Implementation
**Overview:**  
- Designed and implemented the core classes for the system using **object-oriented programming (OOP) principles**, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.  
- Developed a **UML-modeled class structure** for modularity and maintainability.  
- Implemented the following classes:  
  - `Customer` – stores customer details.  
  - `Product` – represents products with attributes like name, ID, and price.  
  - `Order` – manages order details and status.  
  - `Bank` – handles account management, balance updates, and transaction tracking.  

**Key Features:**  
- Modular class design for scalable system extension.  
- Support for linking orders to customer accounts and bank transactions.  
- Ready for integration with console and GUI interfaces.

## Part 2 – Console-Based Ordering System
**Overview:**  
- Developed a **menu-driven console application** for customer order management.  
- Integrated the core classes to allow **placing, viewing, and managing orders**.  
- Ensured smooth interaction with backend logic and data persistence.  

**Key Features:**  
- Browse products and place orders via console prompts.  
- Track order status and update orders as needed.  
- File I/O to save customer accounts, product inventory, and order history between sessions.

## Part 3 – GUI-Based Ordering System
**Overview:**  
- Built a **graphical user interface** to improve usability and user interaction.  
- Linked GUI components with backend logic to handle orders in real-time.  

**Key Features:**  
- Interactive forms, tables, and buttons for browsing products and managing orders.  
- Real-time order status updates and feedback on actions like placing or canceling orders.  
- Persistent data handling for customer accounts, orders, and inventory.
